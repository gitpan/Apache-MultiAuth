NAME

Apache::MultiAuth - Choose from a number of authentication modules at runtime

SYNOPSIS

Put lines like this in your httpd.conf. In this example authorization is requested
for accessing the directory /test. First the credentials (username, password) are
checked against the module Apache::AuthSybase and then against the module
Apache::AuthenSmb. If any of them succeeds, access to /test is granted.

  # in httpd.conf
  # Important : if not set apachectl configtest will complain about syntax errors

 PerlModule  Apache::MultiAuth

  <Location /test>
    AuthName Test
    AuthType Basic

    # PerlSetVars for various Apache::Auth* modules
    # These here are example values for Apache::AuthenSmb
    PerlSetVar myPDC SAMBA
    PerlSetVar myDOMAIN ARBEITSGRUPPE

    # Define order and class of Auth modules to try
    AuthModule Apache::AuthSybase Apache::AuthenSmb

    PerlAuthenHandler Apache::MultiAuth
    require valid-user
  </Location>


DESCRIPTION

Apache::MultiAuth allows you to specify multiple authentication
modules, to be tried in order.  If any module in the list returns OK,
then the user is considered authenticated; if none return OK, then the
MultiAuth module returns AUTH_REQUIRED and the user is reprompted for
credentials. This, depending on the browser, results in a 401 authorization
required message.

This is useful for cases where, for example, you have several
authentication schemes:  for example, NIS, SMB, and htpasswd, and some
of your users are only registered in some of the auth databases.
Using Apache::MultiAuth, they can be queried in order until the right
one is found.


CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES

Apache::MultiAuth allows you to name a number of authentication
modules, using the AuthModule directive.  These modules are queried,
in the order they are provided, until one of them returns OK.
Apache::MultiAuth then condiders authentication to be successful, and
processing continues. If none of the provided authentication modules
returns OK, Apache::MultiAuth passes AUTH_REQUIRED to apache, which
results in a 401 Authorization required error.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

perl Makefile.PL
