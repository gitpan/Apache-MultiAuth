NAME
    Apache::MultiAuth - Choose from a number of authentication modules at
    runtime

SYNOPSIS
      # in httpd.conf
      PerlModule  Apache::MultiAuth

      <Location /test>
        AuthName Test
        AuthType Basic

        # PerlSetVars for various Apache::Auth* modules
        PerlSetVar myPDC SAMBA
        PerlSetVar myDOMAIN ARBEITSGRUPPE

        # Define order and class of Auth modules to try
        AuthModule Apache::AuthSybase Apache::AuthenSmb

        PerlAuthenHandler Apache::MultiAuth
        require valid-user
      </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::MultiAuth allows you to specify multiple authentication modules,
    to be tried in order. If any module in the list returns OK, then the
    user is considered authenticated; if none return OK, then the user is
    reprompted for credentials.

    This is useful for cases where, for example, you have several
    authentication schemes: for example, NIS, SMB, and htpasswd, and some of
    your users are only registered in some of the auth databases. Using
    Apache::MultiAuth, they can be queried in order until the right one is
    found.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES
    Apache::MultiAuth allows you to name a number of authentication modules,
    using the AuthModule directive. These modules are queried, in the order
    they are provided, until one of them returns OK. Apache::MultiAuth then
    condiders authentication to be successful, and processing continues.
